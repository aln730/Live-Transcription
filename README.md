# Live-Transcription
A live transcription service made for CSH's ImagineRIT 2025 project using WhisperAI. Now improved with threading for CPU usage.

Hi everyone!

mictest.py is for determining which index your mic is. Mostly deprecated, as mostly only earlier versions used indexes.

screen.py will create a new window with a black background, and stream all transcription to that window.

LiveTranscription 1 and 2 both will both stream to the terminal.
